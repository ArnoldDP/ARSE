## A simple Requiem list with blackjack and hookers

This is a semi-lightweight and gameplay focused list designed to be engaging every step of the way.

<br>

### How much storage do I need?

Technically only 308gb, but I'd say 350gb to stay on the safe side during installation. You can delete the downloads folder after the list is installed to cut it down to around 200gb

### How heavy is this list?

I tried to keep it somewhat performance friendly. I'd recommend at least 32gbs of ram with a 40gb [pagefile](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/how-to-manage-virtual-memory-pagefile-windows-10,36929.html), a 5600x, and a 3060 ti, although I have seen people run it on lower end hardware during testing. Please note that while it is possible to run with 16gbs of ram, you may run into some stability issues. 

### My performance is bad, is there anything I can do?

```¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ```

I'm working on a few things like custom occlusion, but unless you're very good at modding, there's not much you can do other than wait or upgrade your PC

### This list is hard, can I decrease the difficulty?

Kind of? Requiem lite is included and makes things like stamina a bit easier to manage, but it is still going to be more difficult than vanilla skyrim

### Why no CC content?

I don't like Bethesda's scummy monetization methods and I will not force anyone to pay for the CC in order to play the list. I want this to be as accessible as possible

### I dont like the ENB, can I change it?

Sure! Cabbage, Pi-Cho, Kauz, Ebony ENB, and something new im working on are all included. Other ENBs may have requirements that aren't included in the list, but if you know what you're doing, it shouldn't be too hard.

### does this list support controller?

Yep! Just scroll down to the bottom and you'll see a separator labeled "Controller Optionals"
Enable both the mods in there and you should be good to go

### What body mod does it use for men?

The New Gentleman

### What body mod does it use for women?

3ba/SOFTBODY

This is required software to run this and, as far as I'm aware, any other Wabbajack list. Most of you probably have this installed already, but it never hurts to double check.

### Clean Skyrim Installation

1. Install Skyrim Special Edition through Steam. If you already have it installed, verify the integrity of your game files.

2. Navigate to your Steam Skyrim Data folder

3. Within the data folder, delete the 2 curios files named ```ccbgssse037-curios.bsa``` and ```ccbgssse037-curios.esl```

4. Launch Skyrim from Steam

5. Select Creations from the main menu

6. Search for the Rare Curios mod and download

7. Exit the game

### Wabbajack Setup

1. [Wabbajack](https://www.wabbajack.org)

   Click the big purple download button

2. Install it to a folder that isn't in your documents folder or the root of a drive

3. Launch the Wabbajack client

4. Click the settings button in the bottom left

5. Log into your Nexus account

### Install A.R.S.E. 

**If you download it from the Wabbajack UI**

Just select the download and install folders

**If you downloaded the file from Nexus**

1. Click "Browse Lists"

2. In the top right, click "Install from Disk"

3. Find the A.R.S.E.wabbajack file that you downloaded

4. Select the download and install folders

### PLEASE DO NOT INSTALL WABBAJACK LISTS TO THE SAME FOLDER THAT YOU HAVE THE WABBAJACK CLIENT INSTALLED, THINGS WILL PROBABLY BREAK

### Running the game

1. Navigate to where you installed the list

2. Launch ModOrganizer.exe

3. Click the "Run" button in the top right

4. **(OPTIONAL)** If you don't want to launch MO2 every time you go to play the list, you can click the shortcut button on the bottom right to create a shortcut that launches the list directly.

### Ko-fi supporters

I really don't want to make any of their information public since a lot of them use their real names on there, but thank you to everyone who donated. When my mom died I was between jobs and in school so it was extremely hard on my family financially. Everyone who donated, no matter how little it was, made my life a trillion times easier and I cannot express how grateful I am with words. Some day, hopefully, I'll be able to give enough back to the community to make up for it.
