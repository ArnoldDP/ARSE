## A simple Requiem list with blackjack and hookers

This is a semi-lightweight and gameplay focused list designed to be engaging every step of the way.

<br>

### How much storage do I need?

Technically only 308gb, but I'd say 350gb to stay on the safe side during installation. You can delete the downloads folder after the list is installed to cut it down to around 200gb

### How heavy is this list?

I tried to keep it somewhat performance friendly. I'd recommend at least 32gbs of ram with a 40gb [pagefile](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/how-to-manage-virtual-memory-pagefile-windows-10,36929.html), a 5600x, and a 3060 ti. Although I have seen people run it on lower end hardware during testing. Please note that while it is possible to run with 16gbs of ram, you may run into some stability issues. 

### My performance is bad, is there anything I can do?

```¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ```

I'm working on a few things like custom occlusion, but unless you're very good at modding, there's not much you can do other than wait or upgrade your PC

### This list is hard, can I decrease the difficulty?

Kind of? Requiem lite is included and makes things like stamina a bit easier to manage, but it is still going to be more difficult than vanilla skyrim

### Why no CC content?

I don't like Bethesda's scummy monetization methods and I will not force anyone to pay for the CC in order to play the list. I want this to be as accessible as possible

### I dont like the ENB, can I change it?

Sure! Cabbage, Pi-Cho, and Kauz are included but if you don't like any of those, there are plenty of ENB presets out there to try out

### does this list support controller?

Yep! Just scroll down to the bottom and you'll see a separator labeled "Controller Optionals"
Enable both the mods in there and you should be good to go

### What body mod does it use for men?

### What body mod does it use for women?

### Ko-fi supporters

I really don't want to make any of their information public since a lot of them use their real names on there, but thank you to everyone who donated. When my mom died I was between jobs and in school so it was extremely hard on my family financially. Everyone who donated, no matter how little it was, made my life a trillion times easier and I cannot express how grateful I am with words. Some day, hopefully, I'll be able to give enough back to the community to make up for it.
