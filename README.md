Welcome to A.R.S.E. or Arnold's Requiem of Sensual Experiences

The one and only Requiem list featuring OStim (for now)

This is a semi-lightweight and gameplay focused list designed to be engaging every step of the way. Everything from combat to sleeping has been overhauled and given more depth.

>My performance is bad, is there anything I can do?

```¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ```

I'm working on a few things like custom occlusion, but unless you're very good at modding, there's not much you can do other than wait or upgrade your PC

>This list is hard, can I decrease the difficulty?

Kind of? Requiem lite is included and makes things like stamina a bit easier to manage, but it is still going to be more difficult than vanilla skyrim

>Why no CC content?

I don't like Bethesda's scummy monetization methods and I will not force anyone to pay for the CC in order to play the list. I want this to be as accessible as possible

>I dont like the ENB, can I change it?

Sure! Cabbage, Pi-Cho, and Kauz are included but if you don't like any of those, there are plenty of ENB presets out there to try out

>does this list support controller?

Yep! Just scroll down to the botom and you'll see a separator labeled "Controller Optionals"
Enable both the mods in there and you should be good to go

> What body mod does it use for men?

T.N.G. 

>What body mod does it use for women?
